## Online Pokedex and Calculator

SimpleDex 

A simple web application that displays a given Pokémon's information like a Pokédex and provides a simulator to calculate the damage a target Pokémon would take from a user Pokémon's attack.

## Project Status
Calculator:
- Currently unusable due to issues with loading all possible moves the user can learn.

Online Pokedex: 
- Mostly works as intended, with the Pokémon's basic information, sprite, abilities, stats, and learnset properly displayed; TM numbers are yet to be implemented.

## Next Steps
- Fix the calculator issue where the user's moves do not load properly.
- Integrate TM numbers into the TM Learnset table.
