## Online Pokedex and Calculator

SimpleDex 

A simple web application that displays a given Pokémon's information like a Pokédex and provides a simulator to calculate the damage a target Pokémon would take from a user Pokémon's attack.

## Project Status
Calculator:
- Slow but works as intended.

Online Pokedex: 
- Mostly works as intended, with the Pokémon's basic information, sprite, abilities, stats, and learnset properly displayed; TM numbers are yet to be implemented.

## Next Steps
- Integrate TM numbers into the TM Learnset table.
- Finish caching all 1025 Pokémon which will cut load times down by minutes
- Beautify the calculator.
